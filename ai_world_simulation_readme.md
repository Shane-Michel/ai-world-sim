# AI World Simulation Game

A next-generation, browser-based, AI-driven world simulation where every character thinks, evolves, and reacts to the player. This project blends god-game mechanics, strategy elements, RPG depth, and a fully simulated ecosystem.

---

## 🌍 Overview
This game creates a living world with:
- Dynamic weather, ecosystems, and resource cycles
- Thousands of AI-driven NPCs with goals, memories, and evolving relationships
- Growing kingdoms, wars, diplomacy, trade, technology progression
- Player-controlled god-mode, kingdom management, or single-character play

Everything reacts to the player's actions. Every simulation is unique.

## 🎮 Features
- **AI Civilization Simulation**: Populations grow, migrate, and form societies.
- **NPC Memory + Behavior**: AI characters remember events, hold grudges, form alliances.
- **Dynamic Kingdoms**: Borders shift with war, diplomacy, population changes.
- **God Mode Tools**: Shape terrain, alter weather, bless/curse populations.
- **RPG Mode**: Play as an individual character within the world.
- **Procedural Story Engine**: Events emerge naturally from simulation.
- **Browser-Based**: Runs in Chrome, Safari, Edge — desktop and mobile.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering
- **JavaScript** (no non-portable features)
- **Modular ECS (Entity Component System)** for simulation
- **Web Workers** for heavy AI tasks (optional)
- **LocalStorage** or future server sync for persistent worlds
